        <li>Add carrot and nuts to dry ingredients, along with the wet ingredients, and mix gently until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour into prepared cake tins. Bake for approximately 30-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Gently remove cakes from cake pans and leave on a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>To make the frosting, add the cream cheese and sugar to a mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Add maple syrup and beat again. Spread one third of the frosting onto one of the cake layers. Add the other cake on top. Add remaining frosting on top.</li>
